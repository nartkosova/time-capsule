The Time Capsule application allows users to create digital time capsules that can be sent to themselves or others in the future. Users can write messages, attach photos, and set a future date for the capsule to be delivered via email. This ensures that precious memories, important notes, or heartfelt messages are preserved and delivered at just the right moment.
